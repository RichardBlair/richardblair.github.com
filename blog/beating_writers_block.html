        Three things I do to beat writer's block. 
    </p>
</div>

<p>In my last blog post I talked about how I had experienced writer’s block. This left me in a situation that was uncomfortable and vulnerable. After talking with a few friends I got the impression this is something that happens to a lot of people. I wanted to share with you how I have managed to minimize how often I get writer’s block with these three simple steps.</p>
<h3 id="point-form">Point form</h3>
<p>Putting your thoughts before you allows you to filter out your bad ideas before they end up in a blog post and smeared across the internet. This step isn’t just to get your creative juices flowing, but it’s also a great time for you to direct your attention and steer your focus in the right direction.</p>
<p>Once you have honed in on a topic you need to start hashing out the points you wish to make. Hopefully by now you have established some sort of flow and can get a good collection of points hashed out. They probably won’t all be amazing, but it's okay because you are just trying to get the ball rolling here.</p>
<h3 id="establish-your-tone">Establish your tone</h3>
<p>Sometimes you are trying to compliment someone, appeal to your reader's softer side, build people up, or just flat out rage. Whatever it is you want to communicate you need to be aware of your tone. We have all been misunderstood when communicating over text. The lack of body language makes us vulnerable to misinterpretation and being aware of this gives us the upper hand.</p>
<p>Once you know what tone you want to use you need to filter through your points, eliminating the ones that could potentially destroy your tone. Don’t be disappointed if a large number of your points suddenly can no longer be used. There is nothing wrong with a short post, but there is everything wrong with a post that goes in a direction you didn’t intend it to.</p>
<h3 id="just-write">Just write</h3>
<p>It’s so simple and so hard all at the same time. The main thing to keep in mind here is that nothing is permanent until it is published. It really doesn’t matter if any of the original text is in the final draft; all that matters is that you got to the final draft. </p>
<p>At the end of the day blogging puts you in a vulnerable position, but remember that what you have to say is important. It could be THE thing someone has been waiting to read, it could make someone’s day or alter someone’s perspective. It might be scary, but it will be well worth it.</p>
<p>Put yourself out there. You will be rewarded.</p><div class="author">
